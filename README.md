# Bama Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts car prices using a dataset from **Bama**, a popular car trading platform. The model leverages deep learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions based on features like brand, model, mileage, and more.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Encoding categorical features like `brand`, `model`, and `color`.
  - Handling missing values with mean imputation.
  - Normalizing numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Deep Learning Model**:
  - Implements a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras with hyperparameter tuning via `RandomizedSearchCV`.
  - Incorporates dropout layers for regularization.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Metrics such as RMSE and model scoring are used to evaluate performance.

## Results
The model achieves:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** [Include RMSE result from your script].
- **Model Score:** [Include model score from your script].

## Future Work
- Enhance the model by incorporating more features, such as car condition and market trends.
- Deploy the model as a web application for public use.
